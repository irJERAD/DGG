# Disc Golf Growth
### A Disc Golf Exercise and Performance Tracker

Disc Golf Growth is an application for tracking the growth in your disc golf game through recording exercises and exercise performance data.  

## Tech

The Prototype App is being developed in R using the [Shiny]() and [ShinyDashboard]() libraries - in addition to libraries such as [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) and [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) for the creation of interactive HTML widgets.

The Prototype Application will be hosted as a Web Application on Shinyapps.io.  
Perhaps future development will allow for the porting of native mobile applications.

All features will be fully functional from the prototype web application.  

## Features  

Collect and record data on any and everything that has to do with helping your Disc game out.  

Exercise routines, warm ups, instructional videos or articles will all be recorded from a simple yet context heavy ui.  

A Disc database will be managed by the user as well. This will track all the discs they desire to include in stats and exercises.  

### Wellness Evaluation  

An interesting and unique set of metrics are the Wellness evaluation.  
Here you will answer questions on your perceived level of energy, how limber you feel, the amount of sleep you received the previous night, your emotional status among other queries aimed at capturing an informative perspective on the state of your wellbeing.  
It is no doubt your physical and emotional conditions are tightly coupled with athletic performance so it only makes sense to collect and incorporate all manners of such information in-so-far as it remains convenient and the user feels their effort is paid back in full with valued insights.
